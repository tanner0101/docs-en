# Yo Vapor

Yeoman is a popular scaffolding tool distributed through NPM. There is a beta Vapor 3 generator maintained in Vapor Community ([vapor-community/yeoman](https://github.com/vapor-community/yeoman)) that you can use to create new projects.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-vapor using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo generator-vapor
```

## Create New Project

Once you have installed Yeoman and the Vapor Generator, you can create a new project.

First, create a new folder and `cd` into it:

```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
```

Then, use the `yo` command to generate your new project:

```bash
yo vapor
```


Follow the instructions to choose which packages you would like to use.
